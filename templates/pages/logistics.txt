### Schedule

Here's the rough schedule for the weekend. Some details may change, but you can trust this schedule for making flight and hotel plans:

- _Thursday_ - Out of town guests are encouraged to fly in on Thursday and check out the Rochester area. We'll provide a list of suggested museums and scenic drives for people to see the area.
- _Friday_ - Everybody is invited to the casual Friday evening dinner to meet and mingle with other guests.
- _Saturday_ - A shuttle will be provided from the Fairfield to Artisan Works. The main event will kick off at about 5PM with some cocktails before the ceremony. Dinner will begin at about 7PM. Plan on taking the shuttle back to the Fairfield at the end of the night...
- _Sunday_ - No events are currently planned for Sunday. Feel free to sleep in to recover or enjoy your day in Rochester.
