## Logistics

### Hotels

We've set aside a block of rooms at the [Fairfield Inn in Webster, NY](http://g.co/maps/7c5dg) for the weekend. It has a pool, hot tub, work-out room, and is where we will be staying the week leading up to the nups. The reservation line is (585) 671-1500. Ask for the Wait-Metcalf wedding. The rooms are approximately $109/ night with the option of one king bed, or two queen beds. There will be a shuttle the night of the wedding to and from the venue so no one has to worry about parking or designated drivers. The hotel is minutes away from the rehearsal dinner venue as well. Can we say par-tay?!?

### Flights

The nearest airport is Rochester, NY (`ROC`). Others in the distant area include Buffalo, NY (`BUF`), and Syracuse (`SYR`). Keep in mind there will most likely be no free shuttles from Buffalo or Syracuse to any hotel in the Rochester area.

We recommend using [Kayak.com](http://www.kayak.com) or [Expedia](http://www.expedia.com) to find the best flight deals. Most guests will want to fly in Thursday or Friday 9/20 or 9/22 and out on Sunday 9/23.
