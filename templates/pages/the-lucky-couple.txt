## The Lucky Couple

A long time ago, on a lake far far away (Skaneateles, NY), Sarah and Chris met as a result of a head injury. Sarah was a young and promising Optimist sailor, and Chris was a slightly-less young aspiring Laser skipper. An errant gybe left Sarah with a nasty gash on the forehead, and a dashing man of honor jumped into her boat to sail it to shore. Much to her parents amusement, she returned home at the end of the day with a bandaged noggin and the assertion that she'd met the man she was going to marry. *Little did they know how true that would be.*

They stayed in touch over the years, with the exception of a short period in high school when Sarah feared he had mysteriously died (but in reality he'd just moved to Michigan). Through the years, as their friendship grew, it was clear that they had a special connection that they couldn't find elsewhere. So one Thanksgiving they decided to give it another shot, and a year later Sarah moved out to Seattle to join Chris.

Sarah and Chris live in Seattle, in a little blue house with two temperamental cats ([Widget](http://www.flickr.com/photos/chrismetcalf/74053599/) and Popsie), and the loving, if sometimes moronic, black lab [Maggie](http://facebook.com/maggiedawg).
